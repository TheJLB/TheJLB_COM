			<h3>Traffic Analysis - Bot Dashboard (Tealeaf v7.x)</h3>
			<p>Tealeaf has a number of templates available for version 7.x that can be imported into your environment.  These templates have not been updated for version 8.x as of this writing, but should be updated sometime in the near future.  The templates available for version 7 are:</p>

			<ol><ol><ol>
			<li>Business Analysis</li>
			<li>Traffic Analysis</li>
			<li>Usability Analysis</li>
			<li>Google Analytics</li>
			</ol></ol></ol>

			<p>Within these templates are a number of pre-built Scorecards, KPIs and Dashboards.  Some of these Scorecards, KPIs and Dashboards will require you to map or create events that align with the events in the report.  The two templates I use most frequently are the Traffic Analysis and Usability Analysis templates, which don't require you to map or create any events to get them up and running.</p>

			<p>The Traffic Analysis template provides three dashboards, Mobile Dashboard, Fixed Browser Dashboard, and Bot Dashboard.  These three dashboards segment the traffic on your system into Mobile Type, Browser Type or Bot type.</p>

			<p>In a previous article<b> Tealeaf and Bot/Crawler/Spider traffic:</b> I discuss the ways you can get rid of this traffic from reaching your Long Term Canister (LTC).  The Bot Dashboard is a great starting point to identify the Bots that are generating the largest amount of traffic on your site.  When using the Bot dashboard, I typically focus on the Bot Traffic pie chart.  When you drill-down into this chart from the dashboard, by default it will display the top 10 Bots with the most amount of visits to your site.  From the Event Chart view, you can drill-down to the session level to see the sessions generated by each Bot.  Viewing the session-level information is where you will find the information you need to create the rules necessary to remove Bot traffic from your system.</p>

			<p>If you are running a version 8.x Tealeaf system, and you can't wait for the template to come out, you will either have to search for specific Bots using the search feature, or you will have to create events that will identify Bots automatically.</p>
