			<h3>What do you use to monitor your Tealeaf environment?</h3>
			<p>The simplest and most comprehensive way to monitor your entire Tealeaf environment is to use the built-in PortalStatus/Status Report service.  PortalStatus, when configured properly, will monitor and report on every component of your environment.</p>

			<p>When there are no problems detected, the Tealeaf Status Report will generate details for all the Tealeaf servers configured in the Portal Management page (I will discuss the configuration a little later).  The details generated by the Status Report are useful from both a monitoring and troubleshooting point of view and can be scheduled to run at a specific time, or you can run it manually from the command line.  If/when a problem is detected, the Status Report will be sent to the configured email addresses immediately, indicating the detected problem(s).</p>

			<p>If you aren't already utilizing the PortalStatus/Status Report monitoring tool in your Tealeaf environment, this is the first thing you need to setup.  The information provided through this tool is invaluable in monitoring the day-to-day health of your Tealeaf implementation.  I am always surprised how many companies neglect the self-monitoring capabilities of Tealeaf, either by not configuring it properly, or ignoring the reports it sends out.</p>

			<p>If you have an existing monitoring system in place such as Nagios, Sitescope, or other monitoring system, you could integrate the Tealeaf systems into this system for additional monitoring capabilities.  Before discussing integrating Tealeaf into your existing monitoring system, I think it is important to understand what and how Tealeaf monitors its own services.  The Status Report service runs on the Tealeaf Portal server, and from this server it checks all the servers configured in the 'Manage Servers' section of the Administration console.</p>

			<p>In this example all the servers are called TRAINING8. The servers listed here will be checked by the Status Report.  The Status Report utility will reach out to all the servers listed here, and collect all the monitoring information and package it up for you in a PortalStatus email directly to your inbox.</p>

			<p>As mentioned previously, if you have another monitoring system, you may want to utilize it to monitor your Tealeaf environment.  This, too, should be a pretty simple process, assuming you don't want to duplicate the monitoring that is already being done by the Status Report.  Any decent monitoring system will be able to monitor a systems basic function (is the machine running, are the network adapters working, etc.), and this configuration shouldn't take very long to implement.  With these two systems, you have covered all your bases as far as monitoring your Tealeaf infrastructure.  It is up to you if you want to configure redundant monitoring into your environment, but there is really no reason to do that.</p>

			<p>I have spent many years administering systems, and I have learned one sure thing regarding monitoring and alerts:  The more monitoring and alerts you put in place, the more they get ignored.  When it comes to monitoring I am a firm believer in the KISS theory (Keep It Simple Stupid).  You may have built the most comprehensive and amazing monitoring system anyone has ever seen, but in accomplishing that task, you have also accomplished filling the SPAM folders in numerous inboxes.</p>

			<h3>Configuring the Tealeaf Status Report:</h3>
			<p>How do we configure the Tealeaf Status Report?  As mentioned, the first step is to make sure all your servers are setup and configured properly in the 'Manage Servers' section of the Administration console (see picture above).  Once you have done this, you can modify the TealeafStatus configuration file in Tealeaf --> TMS --> Worldview --> Scheduling Service --> TealeafStatus configuration file (see below).</p>

			<p>Once you are here, you can click on the 'View/Edit button which will display the contents of the TealeafStatus configuration file (below).</p>

			<p>This is where you can configure a number of items for the TealeafStatus report, such as when the report will be sent, time between reports if an error condition exists, blackout periods and more.  The primary item you should be concerned with, though is the [Email] section.  You will notice three variables under the [Email] section: From, To, and Subject.  While the "From" field is not always necessary, depending on how your mail server is setup, it is a good practice to change the domain to your actual FQDN.  The most important field here is the "To" field, this field lets Tealeaf know where to send the StatusReport.  Enter the email address(s) you want to receive the StatusReport, separated by a ";" if you have multiple addresses or groups you want to receive the report.</p>

			<p>The default values in the [TealeafStatus] section are usually sufficient to get started, but feel free to modify these values to better suit your environment.  The last thing we want to check is the [DataService] section.  In most cases the DataService will be running on the same server as the server running the TealeafStatus report, but if it is not, make changes here as necessary.</p>

			<p>Once you are done making your modifications to this file, click 'Save' and then click 'Add Tasks and Submit' (below).</p>

			<p>The next item you need to configure is the Scheduler Service.  The Scheduler Service is one item above the TealeafStatus item shown in the first picture above.  Highlight the Scheduler Service configuration and click on the 'View/Edit' button in the Config Actions menu.</p>

			<p>You want to make sure the TealeafStatus job is enabled, and as you can see from the picture above Job Enable="False".  To change this, you simply need to edit the section '<!-- Run TealeafStatus every 15 minutes -->' to Job Enable="True".  Once you are done with your edits, click the 'Save' button and then click on 'Add Tasks and Submit'.</p>

			<p>Congratulations, you have just configured the Portal Status service on your Tealeaf portal and enabled monitoring for your entire Tealeaf environment.</p>

			<p>In most cases, the Portal Status report is sufficient to monitor your Tealeaf environment.  There may be some outlying cases where you need additional monitoring, but if this is the case you may also want to consider adding redundancy to your Tealeaf environment.
