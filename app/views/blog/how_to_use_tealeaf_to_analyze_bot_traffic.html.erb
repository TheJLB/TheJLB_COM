			<h3>Are they Useful?</h3>
			<p>The question you should be asking yourself with Bots/Crawlers/Spiders (Bots) is, what actionable insights are you driving by keeping these sessions in Tealeaf?  If you can't answer this question without giving it some thought, you probably don't need the hits/sessions cluttering up your Tealeaf system and using valuable disk space.  The reality is, you can gain some insights from this information like, who is indexing your site, and how well is our site being indexed, but this information is readily available from other, more reliable, sources.  For example, you can do a quick search on Google, using the site: command to see how well your site is being indexed.  Let's say, we want to find out how well www.buckknives.com  is indexed on Google.  To find out, you can open your browser to www.google.com, enter site:www.buckknives.com in the search field and hit enter.  By doing this, you discover Google found about 873 results (0.14 seconds).  If you know how many pages there are on your site, you can figure out pretty quickly how well your site is being indexed, and since we are talking about analytics here, you could calculate a quick ratio of how well your site is indexed as follows:</p>

			<ul><ul><ul><li>
			<p>Index Ratio = Pages Indexed / Total pages on your site </p>
			</li></ul></ul></ul>

			<p>Ideally, this ratio would be 1, and all the pages on your site would be indexed and searchable, but this is not usually the case.  Bots don't have the ability to crawl and index all the pages on every site, due to a number of limiting factors such as https, ajax, and flash to name a few.  In addition, you may have chosen to exclude certain pages from being indexed by using the robots.txt file.  In any case, you can figure out what our Index Ratio is fairly easily using the tools provided by the search engines crawling your site.</p>

			<p>If Tealeaf is your only analytics tool, which is pretty unlikely, you might want to store which Bots are crawling your site and what pages they are looking at, but I have yet to come up with a good reason to keep these sessions in your Long Term Canister (LTC) for replay.  Have you ever tried to replay a session generated by a Bot? If you have, you already know, most of these are single-hit sessions and those that aren't are about as exciting as watching paint dry.  For instance, you may want to know which Bots are crawling your site, and what pages are getting indexed, but I don't see much value in keeping these sessions around in the LTC for replay.  Aside from the overhead and additional disk space used by keeping these sessions around in your LTC, the existence of these sessions clouds your data.  Let's say, for simplicity sake, your site gets 100,000 sessions a day, and of these 10,000 are sessions created by Bots, or 10 percent of your sessions are not actual users of your site.  Combine this with all the other extraneous non-user traffic on your site and you can potentially be diluting your statistics pretty significantly.</p>

			<p>Since Bots are easy to identify, and don't provide a lot of actionable information you can't find from other sources, I prefer to drop these hits/sessions using one of the following methods:</p>

			<ul><ul><ul>
			<p><li><%= link_to "Capture Server - DropHit rules", "drophit_rules_for_bot_traffic#path" %></li>
			<li><%= link_to "Processing/Canister Server - DataDrop rules", "datadrop_rules_for_bot_traffic#path" %></li>
			<li><%= link_to "Event - Session Discard", "session_discard_events_for_bots#path" %></li></p>
			</ul></ul></ul>

			<p>Understanding each of these methods will help you determine which solution is the best option for your environment, based on your goals and objectives.</p>
