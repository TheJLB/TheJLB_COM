			<h3>Single-Hit Sessions::Tealeaf</h3>
			<p>I am going to cover some simple steps that will help you get rid of a good portion of the single-hit sessions on your Tealeaf system significantly. Single-hit sessions come from a variety of sources, ranging from monitoring tools within your network to malicious scripts looking for vulnerabilities from outside your network. While this type of traffic does not provide insight as to what your customers are doing, they can help you improve your site by taking a little effort to understand your sessions, you can strengthen and fortify your site.  So, before you make the decision to get rid of all single-hit sessions, read on to make sure this is the right decision for your organization.</p>

			<p>In general, the majority of companies don't spend the time and effort to analyze single-hit sessions, and I think this is a mistake.  As a consultant, I have seen organizations drop all single-hit sessions, other organizations simply ignore them and variations of everything between.  While the approach you take for single-hit sessions on your Tealeaf system is going to depend on your unique situation and organizational needs, you should try my best-practice approach concerning these sessions and what you should be doing with them.</p>

			<p>Because these sessions can take up a significant amount of disk space, you should at a minimum, remove all the single-hit sessions that are from 'known' sources.  If you take a look at the Status Summary from the Tealeaf menu of the Portal (Tealeaf --> System Status --> Status Summary), you will get a high-level understanding of how many single-hit sessions your Tealeaf system is capturing.  On the Active Status tab of the Tealeaf System Status page, the Session Distribution and Single Page Sessions graphs will tell you the Session Count and percent of Site Traffic these sessions/hits represent.  Another place to look is on the Technical Site Metrics dashboard.  The first two graphs on this dashboard are 'One Hit Session Count' and 'One Hit Session Ratio'.  If you are seeing a large percentage of one-hit sessions in the ratio chart, you should do some deeper analysis to determine where these hits are coming from and why you have so many on your site.</p>

			<p>At this point, we have a little better understanding of the problem, by understanding the number of one-hit sessions and what this number represents as a percentage of the total number of sessions on your system.  Let's say, for example, the One Hit Session Ratio for your Tealeaf system is 35 percent.  This means that you are watering down any metrics (KPIs) using the total number of sessions sessions by 35 percent.  This is a significant delta if you are using the investment in your Tealeaf system to drive business critical decisions as you should be.  The more 'noise' you can remove from the data, the more accurate you can be with our reporting and decision making.</p>

			<b>Filtering out the noise:</b>
			<p>Now that you have identified the problem, what do you do about it?  While single-hit sessions are not very likely to provide you with a lot of insight into what your customers are doing, they can tell you a fair amount about other things happening on your site.  It's because of this 'other' information, I don't suggest dropping all single-hit sessions as a general rule.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, I haven't identified any silver bullets that are going to help you quickly identify all the different types of single-hit traffic on your site.  You are going to have to put your analysis hat on and get a little dirty.  A good place to start your analysis is by identifying Bots/Crawlers/Spiders.  This type of traffic occurs on every site, is easy to identify, and can account for a significant amount of the single-hit traffic on your site.  If you haven't done so already, read my other blog post on Bot traffic for more information on how to identify and eliminate this type of traffic.</p>

			<p>Assuming you already took a look at Bot traffic, lets start out by doing a simple search of completed sessions where Hit Count=1, for the last 15~30 minutes.  This should give you a good sample of single-hit sessions to start analyzing.  Start by sorting the session list by time, and from the top of the list, start looking at the Session Info for each of the sessions by clicking on the  icon.  For now, just take a mental note of the IP Address field and look at several of the sessions on the first page of your search results.  If you see the same IP address on several of the sessions, take note of the IP address and perform a new search, using this address as the Client IP.  If you get a large number of sessions with this IP address, are a lot of them single-hit sessions?  If so, you need to determine why you are getting so many from this one machine.  Is the IP address an internal or external address?</p>

			<p>If the address is internal to your network, identify why the machine or device is hitting your web servers and what it is doing.  This may be a monitoring device on your network, or load balancing device checking your web servers to see if they are responding.  I have seen these types of devices generate more than 10,000 sessions per hour in other environments.  Once you have determined the source of the traffic, decide what you want to do with the traffic.  If it is a monitoring or load balancing device, you can safely drop these sessions.  Most networks will have a number of devices that are generate single-hit sessions.  Focus on eliminating as much of the Bot and internal 'noise' traffic as possible.  Once you get done with eliminating the low-hanging fruit, your job gets a little more difficult.</p>

			<p>If the IP address is external to your network, first determine if it is friend or foe.  Is this IP address friendly (customer, vendor, employee, etc.), or is it from an unknown source?  If the source is friendly, you can probably drop these sessions, assuming there isn't anything you want or need to track.  If the address is from an unknown source, is the traffic from this IP address a one-time occurrence?  If this IP address is generating a lot of single-hit sessions over multiple days, you need to determine who they are (if you can) and what they are doing on your site.  Oftentimes, determining what they are doing on your site is enough to make the determination if you want to keep or drop the sessions.  To figure out the 'what' in this situation, open a few of the single-hit sessions from this IP address and take a look at the URL they are requesting.  The URL they are requesting can tell you a lot about whether this is a person or a machine, and what they are attempting to do on your site.  Are they valid or invalid URLs, simple requests for pages, or do they include additional parameters?  All these things will give you clues as to what they are trying to do and why they are on your site.</p>

			<p>If you did a good job of eliminating Bot traffic and any known (internal or external) sources of single-hit traffic, the remaining single-hit sessions can be boiled down into a couple categories: malicious and transient.  Malicious single-hit sessions are the reason I don't recommend dropping all single-hit sessions.  There is a wealth of information contained in these sessions, that can be used to strengthen and fortify your site from these types of attacks.  Transient single-hit sessions are typically not worth the effort of tracking down.  You are never going to get rid of all single-hit sessions in your environment, and spending too much time and effort focusing on these sessions will prove to be counter productive.</p>

			<p>With these simple tips, you can eliminate a good portion of the single-hit sessions on your Tealeaf system.  I have seen instances where eliminating Bots and internal 'noise' traffic reduced single-hit sessions by 70%, significantly reducing the load on the Tealeaf servers, saving disk space and increasing the accuracy of any metrics based off of total sessions/hits.  The remaining single-hit sessions will be the malicious and transient type already mentioned, and I will discuss what you can do about the malicious traffic in a follow up article next week.</p>
